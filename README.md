## For reviewers ☀️

For run this project:

1. Install node_modules with command

```
npm i
```

2. In first terminal run express backend

```
npm run node
```

3. In second terminal run frontend app

```
npm run start
```

### Realised functionality:

- Creating and managing plain text files
- Sort files
- Simple authentication
- Ability to record and then save video
- Add gallery for view pictures, pagination
- Add detail page for pictures and comments
- Typescript is used
- Redux Toolkit is used for state management

### Next steps for extension development:

- Add production authentication with backend and REST API
- Add markup with production design
- Add unit tests for pages and components
- Add search files and directories with node-findit
- Add ability to create directories with mkdir
- Web browser with iframe
- Add slider for gallery, like slick
- Add RSS and pagination, search posts

### Comments

- I don't have much experience in working with Node.js, so it took time to sort it out.
- Also I have never worked with `MediaRecorder` and video streaming before. I didn't want to use some third library for work with video so it took a lot of time from me.
  Now I understand that I should do more simple tasks first, like images gallery or reader.
  I have had nice experience in working with these technologies!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
